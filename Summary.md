This model is designed to bridge the gap between human intent and computer actions, making interactions more natural and seamless through the power of hand gesture recognition.

Applications:
            
            1.Gesture-based Control Systems: Replace traditional input methods with intuitive hand gestures for controlling devices and interfaces.
            
            2.Virtual and Augmented Reality: Enhance user experience in VR/AR environments through natural hand movements.
            
            3.Sign Language Recognition: Facilitate communication for the hearing impaired by translating sign language into text or speech.
            
            4.Interactive Gaming: Create immersive gaming experiences where players can interact through gestures.

Workflow Summary:

                  Data Collection → Preprocessing → Building CNN → Training CNN → Making a singl prediction
<h1><b>Accuracy: 98.95%</b></h1>
